=========

seg_colloc.py implements collocation model proto-type, gives sensible results but is probably way too inefficient to run on real data

not sure about sampling scheme, current one works but may mix badly


How to run on stupid test data?

    python seg.py test.ylt

    python seg_colloc.py test.ylt

or run the fast (Cython) version on the Brent Ratner?

    python run_fast_seg.py br.ylt
